      <title>Do Long-Term Institutional Investors Prefer Future-Focused CEOs?</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper4/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agency theory has long discussed the misalignment between the interests of long-term institutional investors and CEOs. We postulated that future-focused CEOs might mitigate the agency problem as they are more likely to consider long-term goals as more important and invest accordingly. Our analysis drawing on data from 17,983 firm-year observations between 2001 and 2016, however, did not support our initial argumentation. In contrary, it showed a positive relationship between quasi-indexers and investment advisors, both considered as long-term investors, and past-focused CEOs. The possible explanation for this finding draws on the information asymmetry between investors and CEOs. A long-term investment is associated with uncertainty, which prevents the transparency needed to mitigate the information asymmetry. Our study contributes to agency theory and the micro-foundation of strategic management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analyst Experience and Accrual Anomaly: How Do Experienced Analysts Improve Price Efficiency?</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We document that the accrual anomaly is substantially mitigated for firms followed by more experienced analysts. We then examine research and monitoring as possible channels through which experience mitigates mispricing. For firms followed by more experienced analysts, we find that forecast revisions and stock prices respond more positively to the accrual component of earnings. We further find that accrual quality is higher in firms followed by more experienced analysts, which holds after using both propensity score matching and exogenous events of brokerage closures and mergers to control for endogeneity. Finally, our results indicate that only years of experience directly covering the firm matter while experience covering other firms is not associated with greater price efficiency. Collectively, our results are consistent with monitoring being the primary mechanism by which experienced analysts reduce accrual mispricing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Corporate Gender Culture</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.renee-adams.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Renee B. Adams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/paulinegrosjeanperso/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pauline A. Grosjean&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show workplace culture is gendered. We apply computational linguistic models to listed firms’ reports to an Australian gender-equality agency to construct the first systematic measures of ‘corporate gender culture’—firms’ practices pertaining to the treatment of women across seven dimensions, from recruitment and promotion to maternity leave and sexual harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our measures reveal that firms treat women systematically differently from men, but also that gender differentiation varies across industry and firm characteristics. The cultural dimension that best predicts women’s representation in corporate leadership is also the one that best predicts firm performance, namely equality of training opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Does the Market React When Shareholders Lose Power?</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I examine a decision made by a corporate vote tabulating firm that removed the ability of proposal sponsors to obtain interim vote tally data in exempt solicitation campaigns. The decision by the firm reduced the probability of the implementation of shareholder proposals and I use it to infer whether the market views that shareholder proposals create value. I find that the market’s reaction to the decision was, overall, positive and its reaction increased depending on the type of proposal and its sponsor. The results suggest that some shareholder proposals are not viewed as value creating by the market and indicate that it is important to understand how shareholders get involved in corporate affairs to correctly gauge the benefits and costs of shareholder proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Director Skill Networks</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper5/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how firms select directors from other company boards. The resource acquisition theory states that firms select directors to gain specific skills and expertise which is missing on a board. In contrast, homophily theory states that firms select directors that fit into the current pool of directors. Our results lend strong support for the latter and show that firms acquire skills that are neither common nor rare, thus lending additional support for board fit. Our findings highlight why many firms have such difficulties in accessing rare director skills. This might have negative implications on how well boards can fulfill their monitoring role within the principal-agent framework of corporate governance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Financial Fine Print and Earnings Restatements</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper6/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I examine whether changes in footnotes to financial statements may be used to detect firms
that later restate their earnings. I find that when footnotes become longer or more complex,
firms are more likely to restate their earnings. I also report that longer and more complex
footnotes are associated with a more negative stock market reaction when 10-Ks are filed and
greater use of discretionary accruals. CEOs exercise fewer options and analysts are more
likely to stop covering firms when footnotes get longer and more complex. My results point
to importance of paying attention to changes in footnotes and how footnotes could be used to
detect changes in corporate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Location, Managerial Entrenchment, and Short-Term Pressure</title>
      <link>https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper7/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have documented that geographic distance renders remotely located firms more difficult to monitor. This paper asks whether remote firms self-discipline by removing anti-takeover provisions. We find that remote firms are more likely to leave anti-takeover provisions in place, which further enhances managerial entrenchment. Interestingly, this entrenchment does not lead to worse investment decisions by remote firms. In fact, we provide evidence that being out of sight could benefit firms by mitigating short-term pressure from Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;
