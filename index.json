We postulated that future-focused CEOs might mitigate the agency problem as they are more likely to consider long-term goals as more important and invest accordingly. Our analysis drawing on data from 17,983 firm-year observations between 2001 and 2016, however, did not support our initial argumentation. In contrary, it showed a positive relationship between quasi-indexers and investment advisors, both considered as long-term investors, and past-focused CEOs. The possible explanation for this finding draws on the information asymmetry between investors and CEOs. A long-term investment is associated with uncertainty, which prevents the transparency needed to mitigate the information asymmetry. Our study contributes to agency theory and the micro-foundation of strategic management.\n","date":1641508249,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641508249,"objectID":"d3adf1978a54dc4c88c123616c2b635e","permalink":"https://alicakyol.github.io/project/paper4/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T17:30:49-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/paper4/","section":"project","summary":"We report that institutional investors hold more stock in firms with past-focused CEOs.","tags":["agency theory","temporal focus","institutional investors","long-term investors"],"title":"Do Long-Term Institutional Investors Prefer Future-Focused CEOs?","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ali C.

We then examine research and monitoring as possible channels through which experience mitigates mispricing. For firms followed by more experienced analysts, we find that forecast revisions and stock prices respond more positively to the accrual component of earnings. We further find that accrual quality is higher in firms followed by more experienced analysts, which holds after using both propensity score matching and exogenous events of brokerage closures and mergers to control for endogeneity. Finally, our results indicate that only years of experience directly covering the firm matter while experience covering other firms is not associated with greater price efficiency.
